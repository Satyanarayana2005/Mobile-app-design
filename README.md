DESCRIPTION:🍦 Ice Cream Mobile App UI – “Creamy Craving”
This engaging mobile app UI design presents a visually delightful experience for users exploring a range of ice cream treats. Built for user-friendly navigation and an attractive visual appeal, this concept includes the following key screens:

1. Welcome & Category Selection Page
A bright green-themed page introduces users to a variety of ice cream types such as cones, popsicles, milkshakes, cups, sandwiches, and more. Each option is represented by adorable cartoon icons, inviting users to begin their craving journey.

2. Home Page – Brand Showcase
The homepage displays the brand name "Creamy Craving" with a welcoming image of assorted ice cream scoops and a tagline: “Crafted with creamy and perfection.” A prominent Get Started >> button guides users into the product catalog.

3. Ice Cream Flavors & Prices Page
A catalog-style interface neatly lists various flavors like strawberry, vanilla, blueberry, chocolate, butterscotch, and bubblegum with respective prices. Each item is showcased using high-quality images, and a Cart button is included for user purchases.

4. Order Confirmation Page
After placing an order, users are greeted with a green tick and the message “Order Has Been Taken” followed by a warm “Thank you.” message, adding a personal and satisfying conclusion to the experience.
